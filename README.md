## Synopsis

Portfolio Page

This is my second project thru Free Code Camp. It is a front end development project of a developer's portfolio page. I based this on Cool Kitten; a parrallax scrolling responsive framework. I added a CSS responsive menu where the navigation, on mobile phones, is on the bottom, rather than the traditional position of the top.

## Motivation

I am doing this project as a part of the Free Code Camp curriculum and to help build up my portfolio on my website and to receive feedback from the developer community.

## Installation

This project will be installed on github and codepen.

## Tests

I will test the site myself in different browsers and devices.  I will also conduct various speed tests.

## Contributors

This is a solo project and no other contributors will be needed for this project.
